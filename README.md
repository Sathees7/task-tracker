## User Stories

# User Registration
 New users should be able to register an account to utilize the task tracker application. The registration page should contain fields for name, email, password, and confirm password. The system must validate the input and display appropriate error messages for any invalid or missing information. Upon successful registration, users should receive a confirmation message and be directed to the login page.

# User Login
Registered users should have the ability to log in to their accounts to access and manage their tasks. The login page should include fields for email and password. The system must validate the credentials and provide suitable error messages for incorrect login attempts. After a successful login, users should be directed to their dashboard.

# Update Task
 Logged-in users should be able to update their profile information and password to make necessary changes. After a successful update, the changes should be reflected in the user's profile information.

# Delete Task
 Logged-in users should have the option to delete their accounts if they no longer need them to keep their task lists organized. Upon account deletion, all resources and data will be permanently removed. Users are advised to download any data or information they wish to retain before deleting their accounts.
